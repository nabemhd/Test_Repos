[FP- 306] [Date Range Search Issue]

IBM Refference: TS008660189

JiraSM refference:  FP-306

Ticket created: 08.03.2022

Ticket resolved: Closed

Description:

When creating a search the "Alert Date" field is several days behind the current date. And the "Date of Loss" field is over a month old, so we cannot search loss that occurred within the last month.

As per our dev team, the Date of Loss is based on the earliest date of the cases in the in basket. This is working as designed.
